# FruitBelt-CBRS-DataAnalysis
The Datasets are obtained from Fruitbelt Dashboard repository in the UB-IoT-Lab project. The data is available in the pickle file format. The first step is to convert the dataset into CSV format from the pickle format. After the conversion, check the dataset for any errors, if there is a row-colum error fix it by referring to the fixing row-cplumn error python file.
